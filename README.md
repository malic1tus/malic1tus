### 🧙‍♂️ About Me

**Passions** :  
- 🔒 Breaking & building encryption systems (for fun, not chaos).  
- 🎮 Designing gamified tools to hack real-life productivity.  
- 🧪 Experimenting with AR/VR for immersive learning.  

**Tech Arsenal** :  
`Python` | `React` | `Cryptography` | `Node.js` | `HTML/CSS` | `PHP`
